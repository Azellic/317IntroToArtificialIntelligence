Two variations of the N-Queens problem transformed into a 2-player turn-based game where both sides are AI. The variations differed in how the utility score was calculated. 

The purpose was to understand game-tree search algorithms. 

Search methods include MiniMax Search, MiniMax Search with Alpha-Beta Pruning, MiniMax search with depth cutoff and heuristic evaluation, and MiniMax search with depth cutoff, heuristic evaluation, and Alpha-Beta Pruning
